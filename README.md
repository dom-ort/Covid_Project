This repository will be the central location of all projects involving the CDC owid dataset; this project is motivated by the global pandemic plaguing the world.

The SQL portion will be an exploration of the dataset with Tableau functionality in mind; specifically the goal will be to create a top down dashboard. As such the SQL code will attempt to utilize as many location paramaters available in preparation. Since data exploration is the focus the goal will be to find insights that may be buried in the data for scientists and the general public to dessiminate.
